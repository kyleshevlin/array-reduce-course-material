# Array.reduce() Course Material

This repo contains the files used in my Array.reduce() mini-course. Clone this repo to follow along.

The `main` branch is essentially blank, allowing you to follow with me in the videos and blog lessons. The `solutions` branch will contain solutions for each exercise in the course.
